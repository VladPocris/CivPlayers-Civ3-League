It is a tiny map, usually played almost exclusively as 4v4 (otherwise the map template is too big), and with only ancient Unique Unit (UU) civilizations. There are small tweaks to civ balance, and map/contact trading is available at map making. Aside from that, this is Civ 3 at its purest.`,

      details: [
        "Starts with 2 settlers, 2 workers, an explorer, and built-in granary/aqueduct.",

        "4 playable governments, each with unique buildings and wonders.",
        "Faster gameplay: about 2.5 hours per match.",
